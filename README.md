# Elevator Simulation Project
Simulation of one to three elevators during the course of one day with randomized amounts of people arriving on each floor.

Run the file [main.cpp](https://github.com/ericmichalski/Elevator-Simulation/blob/main/main.cpp) to run the entire simulation. The output will print to the console.
See [Description](https://github.com/ericmichalski/Elevator-Simulation/blob/main/Description) for more details and assumptions.
